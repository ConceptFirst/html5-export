# HTML5 document export
An HTML5 alternative to PDF documents.

Presentation by [@craigbuckler](https://twitter.com/craigbuckler) for the [TechExeter conference, Exeter, 7 September 2018](https://techexeter.uk/).

The HTML files provided here show a document preview which permits rudimentary editing and adjustments. A disk icon link downloads a single self-contained HTML file which can be distributed to anyone - like you would do with a PDF file. It can be opened in any browser and viewed offline.

All the preview HTML pages can be directly opened in a browser. A server should not be required, but run `node server.js` if you would prefer to access via `http://localhost:8888/`.

Files:

* `preview0.html` - the basic document structure
* `preview1.html` - content, basic styles, download functionality
* `preview2.html` - page styles, add/remove pages, editing
* `preview3.html` - printer-friendly styles


All code can be used as you like, as long as you don't expect me to take responsibility for it!
